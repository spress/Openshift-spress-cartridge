## Modify your site

* Clone the repository that is associated with your OpenShift gear to your local machine.
* `cd /YOUR-REPOSITORY-FOLDER`
* The `www/` folder contains your Spress site.
* Make your changes and send a pull to repository. You do not need to upload your `_site`
folder that is created by running Spress locally.
